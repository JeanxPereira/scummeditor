1.0.3.0
-------
* Added possibility to edit palette colors. 

* Added possibility to choose the palette entries for costumes.

1.0.2.0
-------
* Simplified and flexibilized the process of reading data blocks. This should make the ScummEditor compatible with more game versions, including modified ones.

* Added compatibility with the Monkey Island 1 DOS Talkie version. This version order data blocks on non-standard ways.

1.0.1.3
-------
* Exported images now generates .idx file for background and objects. When importing back, if exists a .idx file the import process will use it to priotize the search in the palette table. This makes obsolete the fix made on version 1.0.1.2 and should solve a problem on encoding the object #15 on ROOM #53.

1.0.1.2
-------
* Dirty fix to solve a problem reencoding a object 7 on room 25. That bug made the palette of the reencoded object to swap togheter with bernard, when in shadows.

1.0.1.1
-------
* Added a option on the image encoder to select what codec to use. This is because not all DOTT rooms supports decode all game codecs. I don't why this happens, but at least one room on DOTT has this problem. Dunno about others games.
